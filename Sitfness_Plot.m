% Compute the inclination r for each alpha.
% Here, r = (180 - alpha)/2; that is, the beam is assumed to be inclined by an angle r from vertical.
r = (180 - alpha) / 2;  % in degrees

% Compute the axial stiffness of K1 beams.
% The effective length in the denominator is h/(2*cosd(r)).

% Compute the stiffness of the cross-beam K2.
K2 = E * bc * l / dc;

% Compute the effective vertical stiffness Kv of the entire structure using the formula:
% Kv = (K1*K2*cos^2(r)) / (2*(K1*sin^2(r)+K2))

delta = F ./ Kv;
